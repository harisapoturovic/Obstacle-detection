# Obstacle-detection

The system operates on the principle of a single ultrasonic sensor that measures the distance from an object. If the distance is less than 20 units, an LED indicator lights up, signaling the presence of an obstacle nearby. Additionally, a sounder, used as a substitute for a buzzer, is activated. During simulation, the LCD display shows the distance value from the obstacle. If the obstacle is too close, an appropriate message is displayed on the LCD screen. The system utilizes the following components:
* LCD display
* HCSR04 – distance measurement sensor
* LED diode
* Sounder
* STM32F103C6 microcontroller
